## Introduction

Laura Steiner is a Java developer and a professional violist, violinist, and music teacher. In 2020, she graduated from the University of New Mexico with a master's degree in music, with three concentrations: music theory, string pedagogy, and viola performance. Most recently, she graduated from the Deep Dive Coding Java + Android Bootcamp, gaining experience in Android app development to add to previous coding experience during her undergraduate degree. Both apps that Laura developed during the bootcamp reflect her interest in combining music and technology to improve people's lives.

Musically, Laura has many interests and pursuits. She performs a wide variety of music, ranging from music of the Baroque period to new music of the 21st-century. Laura is at home performing as a soloist and in groups of all sizes, from small chamber ensembles to large orchestras. She plays with many groups in the central New Mexico area, including the New Mexico Philharmonic, Chatter, Albuquerque Chamber Soloists, the Santa Fe Symphony, and Santa Fe Pro Musica. She has also composed several small pieces for string instruments. Laura pursues research in music theory and earned distinction for her Master's thesis on emotion in film music, entitled "Musical Wonder and Awe in Narnia: Comparing Two Related Emotions." She has taught music theory and applied violin, viola, and ensemble classes at the university level. Laura currently maintains a small studio of private violin and viola students.
